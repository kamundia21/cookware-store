You need to create icons and save to `public/Image/`:
- `icon-192.png` (192×192)
- `icon-512.png` (512×512)
- `icon-maskable.png` (192×192)

**Free tools:** PWA Builder, Favicon Generator, Canva

See [PWA_ICONS.md](./PWA_ICONS.md) for detailed instructions.

### Change Brand Colors
Edit `public/manifest.json`:
```json
{
  "theme_color": "#8B4513",        // Your brand color
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

Edit `index.html`:
```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#8B4513" />
```
